### Brain Training with Geometry

This book is a comprehensive collection of geometry problems and questions, each accompanied by a variety of solutions and classical Euclidean methods. Geometry is often called the art of observation. By regularly engaging your mind with geometric challenges, you not only expand your knowledge but also sharpen your logical, critical, and creative thinking skills.

As you work through these problems, you will experience a significant boost in mental flexibility and problem-solving ability. The book is thoughtfully organized: each problem is presented on its own page, followed by a detailed solution and a clear geometric demonstration on the next. This format encourages active thinking and deeper understanding before revealing the solution.

Start your journey in geometry today and discover the joy of solving and understanding geometric puzzles!

## About the Author

I studied Biotechnology at university, but later discovered my passion for geometry and prioritized it over Biotech. I've always been fascinated with geometric shapes and their properties—how amazing hidden relationships emerge when we apply different configurations and restrictions. I see geometry as a powerful way to train the mind to think outside the box and to stimulate imagination!
